# Fix pnpm/node_modules on non-POSIX filesystems (Developer UX)

## Context
pnpm uses symlinks/hardlinks for `node_modules`. On exFAT/FAT/limited mounts this causes EPERM errors.

## Goal
Improve developer experience by detecting unsafe filesystems and printing a clear actionable message.

## Tasks
- [ ] In `tools/control.py` / runner, detect mount FS type for the repo path on Linux.
- [ ] If filesystem is exFAT/FAT/unsupported for symlinks, warn and propose:
  - move repo to ext4/btrfs
  - or bind-mount `node_modules` to a Linux filesystem
- [ ] Ensure `--start` does not skip install merely because `node_modules` exists; verify `node_modules/.bin/tauri` exists.

## Acceptance Criteria
- On unsupported FS, the tool prints a clear warning before pnpm fails.
- If `node_modules` is incomplete, the tool re-runs `pnpm install`.

## Notes
This issue is for dev tooling only, not end-user runtime.
