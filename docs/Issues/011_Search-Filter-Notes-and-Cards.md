# Search/Filter Notes and Cards

## Context
With many notes/cards, navigation needs search.

## Goal
Provide search and filtering in the Library:
- filter notes by filename/path
- optional: filter cards by question text

## Tasks
- [ ] Add search input to Library/Notizen panel.
- [ ] Implement case-insensitive filtering.
- [ ] Add quick filters (e.g., folder, recently opened).
- [ ] Keep UI responsive with 1000+ files (virtualize if needed).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Typing in search narrows the list immediately.
- Clearing search restores full list.

## Notes
This can remain frontend-only initially.
