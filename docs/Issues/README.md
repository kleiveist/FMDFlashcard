# FMD Flashcard – Issue Pack

This folder contains small, structured GitHub issues for the next development steps.

## How to use
1. Create corresponding GitHub issues in your repository.
2. Copy/paste each Markdown file into a new issue.
3. Keep titles as-is; adjust scope as needed.

## Ordering
Issues are numbered to suggest a sensible sequence, but they can be re-ordered depending on priorities:
- Extract cards first (005–007)
- Then scheduling + persistence (008–009)
- Then UX improvements (003–004, 011)
- Tooling and watcher are optional improvements (010, 012)
